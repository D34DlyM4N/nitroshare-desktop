/**
 * @brief Method for transmitting bundles to other devices
 *
 * Data is sent to another device using a transport, such as a simple TCP
 * socket or an encrypted TLS session. The information necessary to connect to
 * the remote device and initiate the transfer is passed to start(). Once the
 * connection succeeds and is ready for data transfer, the connected() signal
 * is emitted.
 *
 * In order to avoid blocking the UI thread, all of the virtual methods are
 * invoked asynchronously. Errors are communicated through the error() signal.
