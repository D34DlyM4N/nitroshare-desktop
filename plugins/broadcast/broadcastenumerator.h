 * @brief Discover devices through IPv4 broadcast
 *
 * This plugin allows for interoperability with the 0.3.x releases which use
 * IPv4 broadcast for device discovery. The mDNS plugin will eventually
 * replace this plugin due to its support for IPv6 and less noise.
 *
 * If no ping is received from a device after a fixed amount of time has
 * expired, the device is considered "expired" and is removed.
